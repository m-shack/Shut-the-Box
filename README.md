# Shut-the-Box
Game of chance and skill

Shut-the-Box is game based on a physical game made in a "box." The box contains 9 numbered tiles that are initially rotated to an up-facing position. The player rolls two dice, and based on the sum of the die must make a choice to remove that number from the tiles. Then roll again, and do the same thing until 1) you can't make a further move, or 2) all tiles are turned down in which you "WIN" and shut the box.

The current version is text based. My plan is to add GUI features.
